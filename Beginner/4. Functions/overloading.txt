overloading 

in c++ there is no need to twist names to include parameter information

Two functions can have the same name as long as the compiler can tell them apart

    - taking a different number of arguments is a great way to distinguish overloiads 
    - Return type can never be used to distinguish overloads 
    - Taking the same number of arguments, but of different types, is risky
