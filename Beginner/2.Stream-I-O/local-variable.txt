local variable 

variable in c++ have a type 

    - string, number, date, employee, etc
    - some types are built into the language 
    - some are user defined ' some "users" are actually library writers' 

variables must be declared before they are used 
    - int limit; ( this is a variable nammed limit);



built in types are not initialized for you
